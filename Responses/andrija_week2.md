Going through the AI Revolution Pt. 1, there are a few things that struck me/that I had some questions about. First, is the idea of exponential and certain technological advancement? The exponential idea makes sense, and is optimistic in terms of having a belief in advancements even if they are inconceivable to us at the moment. But I wonder if the optimism is not misleading. Kurzweil seems to be sure that technological advancement is certain but is it not possible that we could actually hit some cognitive or practical impasses. I also wonder whether developing AGIs and ASIs will be possible through advancement of existing tech, or whether replicating the kind of structures that make up our brain, which potentially don’t work the same way as digital computers do, through new computational technologies will be required. 

As for Paperclips. First, I was really surprised. I didn’t really know what to expect but a market simulation game was not it. It was very confusing at first, but I like that the developers ease you in, by gradually introducing more elements to the game. I’m not sure if this is what was happening but I got the sense of a me vs. the market (the AI) situation, and that it’s trying to learn my techniques, as I am trying to learn them, and then adjusting to it, while I also have to adjust?
